🔐 **Excited to share my latest cybersecurity project!**

I've successfully designed and deployed a **production-grade Web Application Firewall (WAF)** solution from scratch, gaining hands-on experience with enterprise security technologies.

**🛡️ What I Built:**
→ ModSecurity WAF with OWASP Core Rule Set (849+ active security rules)
→ Protection against OWASP Top 10 attacks (SQLi, XSS, LFI, RCE)
→ Real-time security monitoring with Grafana dashboards
→ Centralized logging using Prometheus + Loki stack
→ SSL/TLS encryption with Let's Encrypt certificates
→ Containerized deployment using Docker

**📊 Key Achievements:**
✅ Blocked 100% of common attack vectors in testing
✅ Achieved <20ms latency overhead
✅ Built comprehensive security monitoring with custom dashboards
✅ Documented for PCI DSS & OWASP compliance alignment

**🔧 Technologies Used:**
ModSecurity 3.0 | OWASP CRS | Nginx | Docker | Prometheus | Grafana | Loki | Let's Encrypt | Linux

This project strengthened my understanding of:
• Defense-in-depth security architecture
• Web application attack patterns and prevention
• Security monitoring and incident response
• Infrastructure as Code practices

The complete architecture includes 9 integrated containers working together to provide layered security protection.

I'm passionate about building secure systems and eager to contribute to organizations focused on protecting their digital assets.

💬 I'd love to connect with fellow security professionals! What WAF solutions are you working with?

### Project Title
**Enterprise Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Real-Time Security Monitoring**

---

### Project Description

Designed and deployed a production-ready Web Application Firewall solution to protect web applications against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. This project demonstrates practical skills in security engineering, infrastructure deployment, and security monitoring.

**Architecture Overview:**
Built a containerized security infrastructure using Docker Compose, featuring ModSecurity 3.0 as the WAF engine with OWASP Core Rule Set 3.3.8 providing 849+ active security rules. The solution integrates a complete monitoring stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for real-time threat visibility.

**Security Capabilities:**
• SQL Injection (SQLi) prevention with 50+ detection rules
• Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection with 40+ pattern detections  
• Local/Remote File Inclusion (LFI/RFI) blocking
• Remote Code Execution (RCE) prevention
• Protocol anomaly detection and rate limiting
• Anomaly scoring system with configurable thresholds

**Monitoring & Observability:**
• Custom Grafana dashboards for security event visualization
• Real-time attack detection and alerting
• Centralized log aggregation with 31-day retention
• System performance metrics (CPU, memory, network)

**Key Technical Implementations:**
• Nginx reverse proxy with SSL/TLS termination
• Let's Encrypt automated certificate management
• Multi-domain SSL configuration
• Docker containerization (9 integrated services)
• Prometheus metrics collection and alerting
• Loki log aggregation with LogQL querying

**Documentation Delivered:**
• Architecture and deployment guides
• Security rules configuration documentation
• Compliance mapping (OWASP Top 10, PCI DSS 4.0)
• Performance optimization report
• Operations runbook and training materials

**Results:**
• 100% block rate for common attack patterns in testing
• Sub-20ms latency overhead
• Production-ready security monitoring
• Comprehensive compliance documentation
